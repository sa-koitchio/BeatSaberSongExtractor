# BeatSaberSongExtractor
Repository for a beat saber custom song audio extractor made in python

Short description on how to use;
If you just care about the exe, just download that, if you want the janky source code, go for the whole.

Step 1: Choose a "source folder" 
Here is the important stuff: NEVER choose the original game folder because the program will RENAME the audio files.
Choosing the original "Custom Songs" folder will BREAK the songs In-Game

Step 2: Choose an "output" folder
Take any folder you want to store your songs in,
empty folders are recommended.

Step 3: Click on "Convert"
This will copy, rename and convert all the song files to their respective In-Game titles.
Output will be .wav files.

Congrats! You will now find all your songs in your OUTPUT folder.
